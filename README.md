# fitness tracker
## a python notebook for visualise my recorded bike tours
### sure, there are many cool apps and tools to visualise your tracked data, but for increasing my python skills i want to try it by my own.
#### my agenda / my todos:

done......read a fitfile from my bike computer  
done......parse the fitfile  
done......make some plots (for example elevation vs distance)  
..........create a route (polyline)  
..........reduce the geometry  
..........if not exisits: save it in a sqlite/spatialite db  
..........create a map  
..........load a dem from (for examplegoogle earth engine)  
..........add elevation to the plot
